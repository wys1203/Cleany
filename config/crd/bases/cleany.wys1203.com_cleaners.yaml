                      This field is optional and can be used to specify a Lua function

                      have already been selected using the ResourceSelector field.
                      The function will receive the array of resources selected by ResourceSelectors.
                      If this field is not specified, all resources selected by the ResourceSelector
                      field will be considered.
                      This field allows to perform more complex filtering or selection operations
                      on the resources, looking at all resources together.
                      This can be useful for more sophisticated tasks, such as identifying resources
                      that are related to each other or that have similar properties.
